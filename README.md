# Overhaul Maps:

A set of unique maps that tend to have fun gimmicks and dynamic elements that encourage map-centric play.

# It is recommended that you reduce the screen shake settings by going to Mods -> Performance Improvements -> Miscellaneous and reducing the screen shake strength value from 100 to ~10. The overhead light shake and chromatic aberrations can also be disabled if desired.
